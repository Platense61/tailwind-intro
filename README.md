# tailwind-intro Documentation

For this project i created a nodeJS application and utilized tailwind to style my webpage. The hardest part of this project was getting tailwind to work with node. 

For my implementation i decided to create a carousel to allow the user to switch between backgrounds. All backgrounds have the theme of nature. To do this i had to utilize more javascript to allow for this functionality. Another key feature of the page is the mobile nav bar.
